I remember my first day in NSS, it was a dream come true . Now I am here million miles way from the first day. I had a good, hard, unforgotable time on the bootcamp. Today i am able to read, write, understand and use many programming languages. When I came to NSS, I thought I
had known some but after I have learned a lot , I came to a realization that I have a long way to learn and grow. I have been enjoying being part of the UNICORN, dealing with  new topic every day, participating in group projects, having fun, over all the deliciouse  cakes.Oh i forget 'the New Star War" which was a real war!
This is my first profile webpage for the good memories in NSS. I love you all NSS.
